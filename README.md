> This project uses Python 3.7 within a virtual environment built with `pipenv`. Using the following command is recommended:

```bash
pipenv shell --python 3.7
```

## A small hack

This challenge includes an interactive menu based on command line, so, in order to execute it, just run the main file:

```bash
python main.py
```
